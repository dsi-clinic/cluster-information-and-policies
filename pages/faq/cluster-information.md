# Current Cluster Information

As of Sept 2025, the following table summarizes the DSI cluster resources. Some resources are reserved for specific initiatives or grants.

## Total Cluster Resources

| Resource Type   | Number of Units |
|:----------------|----------------:|
| Number of Nodes | 29              |
| Total Cores     | 2,720            |
| Total Storage   | 1.5PB           |
| GPUs            | 32 Nvidia A40 48G  <br/> 60  Nvidia A100 80G <br/> 12 Nvidia L40S 48G  <br/> 16 Nvidia H100 80G  <br/> 20 Nvidia H200 140G <br/> Total: 140  |

## Space Availability and Server Room

The server room is power-constrained. While each rack can hold 8 nodes physically, power typically supports 4 nodes per rack. With 8 open racks, we anticipate capacity for approximately 24 additional nodes (24 + 17 = 41 total), hardware-dependent.
