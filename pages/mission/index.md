The mission of the Data Science Institute Cluster is to support the educational and research activities of the DSI as they relate to high-performance, computationally expensive operations. The Cluster is not designed to support any computational load, but instead focused 

The DSI Cluster supports:

* High-performance _computational_ operations using standard hardware via a common scheduling interface (SLURM) and traditional unix tools and interfaces.
* This includes large scale data processing on GPUs and CPUs.
* The cluster support both _private_ partitions purchased under our [purchasing policy](../../_policies/purchasing-content.md) as well as both research and teaching using our general partition.

The cluster does NOT support:

* Real-time operations
* Significant data collection operations (such as web scraping)
* Web servers
* High-uptime systems
* High-privacy data storage (HIPPA/SOC2/etc.)
