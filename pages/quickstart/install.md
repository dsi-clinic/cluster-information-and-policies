The DSI cluster makes use of **environments** to manage software and dependencies. This approach ensures reproducibility and prevents conflicts with system-wide installations.  

Please refer to the [Using the Cluster: Environments]({{ '/using-the-cluster/environments' | relative_url }}) page for detailed instructions on creating and managing environments for your projects.
