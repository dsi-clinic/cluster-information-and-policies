Accessing the DSI cluster securely requires the use of **SSH keys**. SSH keys are more secure than passwords and are the only supported method for authentication. No VPN is required for access.

For instructions on generating SSH keys and connecting to the cluster, please see the official tutorial:

[Using SSH, GitHub, and the Cluster (DSI Clinic)](https://clinic.ds.uchicago.edu/tutorials/ssh_github_cluster.html)
