Accessing the DSI cluster securely requires the use of **SSH keys**. 

For instructions on generating SSH keys and connecting to the cluster, please see the documentation [here](https://clinic.ds.uchicago.edu/tutorials/ssh_github_cluster.html).

Note that you must have a DSI Cluster account (information [here](accounts.md)) before you are able to access the cluster.
