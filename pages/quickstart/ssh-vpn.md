Accessing the DSI cluster securely requires the use of **SSH keys** and, when connecting from off-campus, the Universityâ€™s **cVPN service**. SSH keys are more secure than passwords and are the only supported method for authentication. The VPN ensures that only authorized users on the University network can reach the cluster.  



For instructions on generating SSH keys and connecting to the cluster via VPN, please see the official tutorial:
