# Getting Access

Users of the DSI cluster must meet one of the following criteria:

1.  Have a DSI-related grant.
2.  Be a member of the DSI or an affiliated faculty.
3.  Be a student with written approval from a DSI faculty mentor.

If you are looking for compute resources and are more generally affiliated with the University, we recommend contacting [RCC](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/).

## Requesting Access

To gain access to the DSI cluster, you must email the tech staff team directly. Please follow these steps:

1. Send an email to **[techstaff@cs.uchicago.edu](mailto:techstaff@cs.uchicago.edu)**.  Making sure to mention that this is about the _DSI_ cluster, as there are multiple clusters on campus.
2. In your email, include:  
   - Your **CNetID**  
   - A brief description of your **access affiliation**  
   - If you are working under a PI, **CC your PI** on the email   
3. The tech staff will review your request and contact you once your account has been created.
