# Interactive Sessions (JupyterLab)

In addition to batch processing, the cluster also supports **interactive sessions**. These allow you to work directly on a compute node, which can be helpful when you need a more hands-on workflow instead of submitting jobs and waiting for them to finish.  
While batch jobs are ideal for long-running, non-interactive tasks, you will often need direct, interactive access to a compute node for tasks like:
- Developing and debugging your code.
- Running applications with a graphical user interface (GUI), such as JupyterLab.
- Performing tasks that require real-time feedback.
