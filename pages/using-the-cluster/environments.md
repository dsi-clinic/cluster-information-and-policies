# Environment management (Conda, venv)

The DSI cluster provides a baseline set of software, but for most research projects, you will need to install specific packages and libraries. To ensure a stable and reproducible environment without interfering with system-wide installations, we require users to manage their own software using environment management tools.

We strongly recommend using either **MiniConda** or **MicroMamba** to create isolated software environments for your projects. This approach prevents conflicts with system libraries and makes your research more reproducible.

## Using MiniConda

For instructions on installing and using MiniConda, please see the official Anaconda documentation:
