## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- **Poly system not responding**: Touch the screen to wake it up, or check if the system is powered on
- **Cannot share screen**: Ensure your laptop and the Poly system are on the same network
- **Meeting ID not working**: Double-check the Meeting ID for typos

### Audio Problems
- **No sound**: Check the volume controls on the TV screen
- **Echo during calls**: Mute your laptop speakers and use the room's audio system only
- **Participants can't hear you**: Check that the Poly microphone is not muted (look for mute indicator on screen)

### Video Issues
- **Camera not working**: Check if the camera is physically blocked or if privacy mode is enabled
- **Poor video quality**: Ensure good lighting in the room and check your network connection

### System Reset
If you encounter persistent issues:
1. Tap the system menu on the Poly screen
2. Select "Restart System" if available, or power cycle the TV
3. Contact IT support if problems persist

## Best Practices

- **Test before important meetings**: Arrive 5-10 minutes early to test audio and video
- **End your sessions**: Always end your meeting when finished to ensure the room is ready for the next user
- **Network connectivity**: For best performance, use a wired connection on your laptop when possible
- **Screen sharing**: Close unnecessary applications before sharing your screen to maintain performance
