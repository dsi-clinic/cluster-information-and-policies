## Office Hours

We hold regular office hours where you can get help with cluster-related questions, troubleshoot issues, or discuss your computational needs with our team. Check the **#dsi-cluster-information** Slack channel for the current office hours schedule.

## User Group Meetings

We host user group meetings occasionally to share updates, discuss cluster usage, and gather feedback from our community. These meetings are a great opportunity to learn about new features, best practices, and connect with other cluster users.

Please follow announcements in our Slack channel **#dsi-cluster-information** for information about when and where the next meeting will be held.
