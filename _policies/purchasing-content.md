# Cluster Purchase Guide

This document contains an overview of the policies around (a) purchasing additional equipment for the DSI cluster and (b) the priorities that we can grant on that provisioned hardware.



## Welcome to the DSI Investor Guidelines

Welcome to the DSI Cluster Investment Framework, our pathway to advancing computational research through strategic partnerships. Our mission encourages investor engagement by offering priority access to select hardware and the broader cluster resources. This document, regularly updated based on feedback and technological advancements, embodies our commitment to adaptability and collaborative progress. Together, we aim to accelerate innovation and enhance research efficiency in a constantly evolving tech landscape.


## Overview and Framework


Our framework:
1. We want to encourage group investment in the DSI cluster by granting priorities to specific purchased hardware to the people/project who made that purchase.
2. We want to make sure that all purchased hardware conforms to the requirements of the cluster.
3. We want to make sure that there is a defined lifecycle policy associated with each purchase in terms of both physical life and priority access.

This document contains a description of the implementation details of this framework.

## Minimum Investment for Priority Hardware Solution

Depending on the current configuration of the cluster there are limitations to what types of hardware can be added. 

The minimum investment required to gain priority access to hardware is approximately $100,000. However, the specific hardware specifications fluctuate due to current technological trends and market availability.

As of winter 2024, this investment looks like the following, with a total cost of roughly $115,000:

* 4x Nvidia H100 80GB GPUs
* 2x Intel LGA4677 CPUs
* 1TB RAM 
* Misc. server components and cables
    
For up-to-date information on the minimum required specifications, please contact DSI Techstaff.

## Current minimum hardware

As of Winter 2024, the following types of GPUs are allowed and not-allowed to be purchased for the cluster. Note that this list is not comprehensive, if there are any questions about particular types of GPUs please contact DSI Techstaff.

| Allowable | Not Allowed |
| --- | --- |
| - H100<br>- A100<br>- L405S<br>- A40 (Getting a bit long in the tooth) | - 4090 | 

There are a number of different reasons that hardware may not be allowed. We will try to keep this up to date regarding why certain decisions were made

In the case of the 4090, at the time of this writing there are a number of reasons for not putting it in the cluster:
1. These are consumer grade cards which NVIDIA's contracts frown on putting in servers (while one of our providers has mentioned they would "play ball", this is not something we want partake in).
2. Installing them will not be easy and will require adding additional software and complexity into the server to manage them. 
3. There are a number of unknowns about how they would integrate into our current clusters queue and allocation systems. Since these are consumer grade cards they do expose the same management tools and data as the enterprise grade GPUs. While we believe it is possible to get these working in our current system it would be both time consuming and potentially increase the fragility of the cluster.
4. Consumer grade cards are not designed for the type of workloads that we do for AI training. The lifespan of the 4090 in particular is known to not be high.



## Definition of Priority

"Priority" within the DSI Cluster signifies the scheduling precedence assigned to jobs, based on SLURM's established policies. This status, influenced by an investor's contribution and the project's needs, ensures that high-priority jobs are queued and allocated resources more swiftly. Adopting SLURM's best practices allows us to balance resource distribution efficiently, rewarding investments with enhanced access and supporting advanced research activities.

## Lifecycle Polices

There are a number of different factors that effect the lifecycle of any purchase as well as the associated priority policies.

* Usage Duration: We will continue to operate GPUs in our cluster as long as they do not experience a fatal malfunction. This commitment is in line with our goal to maximize the utility of our resources while ensuring effective support for research needs.

* End of Life Policy: The retirement of any GPU model from our cluster will align with NVIDIA's end-of-life policies for that particular model. We will proactively monitor these guidelines to ensure our hardware remains current and supported.

### Duration of Access for Grants with a Defined Timeline

* Access Duration: Investors who meet the investment requirements will receive priority access to the hardware they fund for the duration of the grant. 

* Maximum Priority Duration: The general rule is a maximum of five years of priority access to be provided as this roughly aligns with hardware generations. If there are specific concerns about this timeline then additional terms can be discussed, but it may require specific hardware to be purchased.


### Handling Grants without a Defined Timeline

* Default Allocation: Grants without a specified timeline will have a default allocation period of three years. Extensions require discussion and agreement.

* Provisional Allocations: Initial allocation period with options for extension based on progress and resource availability.

* Project Milestones: Regular milestone reporting is encouraged or required for ongoing validation of resource allocation.

## Other Purchasing Considerations

* Resource Re-allocation Post-Grant: Develop policies for transitioning resources back to the general pool after the grant period, including a phased reduction in priority and a grace period for data migration.

* Over-Subscription Policies: Implement policies for over-subscription to optimize resource utilization. Clear guidelines will manage and prioritize over-subscription.

* Emergency Resource Allocation: Implement a policy for time-sensitive research or critical data processing, offering temporary priority override.

* Transparency in Resource Allocation: Maintain a transparent record or dashboard to display resource allocation and usage, enhancing trust and understanding among users.

* Semi-Priority Queue Access: For investors unable to meet the minimum investment requirements, there may be an opportunity to discuss access to semi-priority queues, contingent upon space availability.

### Troubleshooting and Support

* Software issues (such as those related to the OS, server configuration and SLURM) and hardware issues are the responsibility of the system administrators. Debugging code and project level assistance is the responsibility of the person writing and executing the code.

* If there are any critial failures in the cluster, the system administrators will do their best to diagnose and correct any problems. Hardware isn't unbreakable and if something is no longer usable by the cluster it will be removed, or replaced if possible.
