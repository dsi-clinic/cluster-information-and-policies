## DSI Cluster Information (as of May 2024)

This document contains specification information on the DSI Cluster. The table shows the total available resources on the cluster. Some resources, however, are reserved for specific research initiatives and grants of principal investigators.

### Total Cluster Resources
---

This table contains the total resources on the cluster.


| Resource Type        | Number of Units | 
|:---------------------|:--|
| Number of Nodes | 24 |
| Total Cores | 1504 |
| Total Storage | 1.5PB |
| GPUs | 32 Nvidia A40 48G GPUs  <br/> 60 Nvidia A100 80G GPUs <br/> 12 Nvidia L40S 48G GPUs <br/> 16 Nvidia H100 80G GPUs |

### Space Availability and Server Room 

The server room has limited capacity. In the current configuration, we can house a total of 41 nodes.

There is a specific issue with power supplies - while each rack can physically hold 8 nodes, the power supplies for each rack can only power 4 nodes. There are currently 8 open racks leading to 24 additional nodes available (24 + 17 = 41). One caveat is that this is power usage dependent. Depending on the type of hardware purchased, it _may_ be possible to put more than 4 nodes on a rack.
