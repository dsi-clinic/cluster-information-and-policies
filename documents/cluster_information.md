## DSI Cluster Information (as of September 2023)

This document contains specification information on the DSI Cluster. The table shows the total available resources on the cluster. Some resources, however, are reserved for specific research initiatives, grants of principal investigators. 

### Total Cluster Resources
---

This table contains the total resources on the cluster.


| Resource Type        | Number of Units | 
|:---------------------|--:|
Number of Nodes	| 21
Total Cores	| 1280
Total Storage |  768TB
GPUs | 40 Nvidia A40 48G GPUs  <br/> 56 Nvidia A100 80G GPUs <br/> 12 Nvidia L40S 48G GPUs <br/> 4 Nvidia H100 80G GPUs

### Space Availability and Server Room 

The server room itself is also limited. In the current configuration we expect to be able to house of a total 41 total nodes.

Specifically there is an issue with power supplies. While each rack can physically hold 8 nodes, the power supplies associated with each rack can only power 4. There are currently 8 open racks leading to 24 additional nodes available (24 + 17 = 41). One caveat with the above is that it is power use dependent. Depending on the type of hardware purchased it _may_ be possible to put more than 4 nodes on a rack.
