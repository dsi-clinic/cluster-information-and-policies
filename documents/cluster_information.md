## DSI Cluster Information (as of September 2023)

This document contains specification information on the DSI Cluster. There are two sets of specifications provided. The first set of numbers are the total available resources on the cluster. Some resources, however, are reserved for specific research initiatives, grants of principal investigators. The second table contains specification information on resources which are generally available.

Depending on the use case either set of numbers may be appropriate.

### Total Cluster Resources
---

This table contains the total resources on the cluster.


| Resource Type        | Number of Units | 
|:---------------------|--:|
Number of Nodes	| 17
Total Cores	| 1088
Total Storage |  204TB
GPUs | 48 Nvidia A40 48G GPUs  <br/> 48 Nvidia A100 80G GPUs

### Generally Available Resources
---

The table below contains generally available resources on the cluster.

| Resource Type        | Number of Units | 
|:---------------------|--:|
Number of Nodes | 16
Total Cores | 768
Total Storage | 204TB
GPUs | 48 Nvidia A40 48G GPUs  <br/> 40 Nvidia A100 80G GPUs


### Space Availability and Server Room 

The server room itself is also limited. In the current configuration we expect to be able to house of a total 41 total nodes.

Specifically there is an issue with power supplies. While each rack can physically hold 8 nodes, the power supplies associated with each rack can only power 4. There are currently 8 open racks leading to 24 additional nodes available (24 + 17 = 41). One caveat with the above is that it is power use dependent. Depending on the type of hardware purchased it _may_ be possible to put more than 4 nodes on a rack.

There is a plan to move to a larger space in the spring / summer of 2024.
