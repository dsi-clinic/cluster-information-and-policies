# Cluster Purchase Guide

This document contains an overview of the policies around (a) purchasing additional equipment for the DSI cluster and (b) the priorities that we can grant on that provisioned hardware.

Our framework:
1. We want to encourage group investment in the DSI cluster by granting priorities to specific purchased hardware to the people/project who made that purchase.
2. We want to make sure that all purchased hardware conforms to the requirements of the cluster.
3. We want to make sure that there is a defined lifecycle policy associated with each purchase in terms of both physical life and priority access.

This document contains a description of the implementation details of this framework.

## Minimum Investment for Priority Hardware Solution:

Depending on the current configuration of the cluster there are limitations to what types of hardware can be added. 

The minimum investment required to gain priority access to hardware is approximately $100,000. However, the specific hardware specifications fluctuate due to current technological trends and market availability.

As of winter 2024, this investment looks like the follow, with a total cost of roughly \$115,000:

* 4x Nvidia H100 80GB GPUs
* 2x Intel LGA4677 CPUs
* 1TB RAM 
* Misc. server components and cables
    
For up-to-date information on the minimum required specifications, please contact DSI Techstaff.

## Lifecycle Polices

There are a number of different factors that effect the lifecycle of any purchase as well as the associated priority policies.

Duration of Access:

Investors who meet the investment requirements will receive priority access to the hardware they fund for the duration of the grant.

Handling Grants without a Defined Timeline

* Default Allocation: Grants without a specified timeline will have a default allocation period of three years. Extensions require discussion and agreement.

* Provisional Allocations: Initial allocation period with options for extension based on progress and resource availability.

* Project Milestones: Regular milestone reporting is encouraged or required for ongoing validation of resource allocation.

## Other Considerations

Resource Re-allocation Post-Grant: Develop policies for transitioning resources back to the general pool after the grant period, including a phased reduction in priority and a grace period for data migration.

Over-Subscription Policies: Implement policies for over-subscription to optimize resource utilization. Clear guidelines will manage and prioritize over-subscription.

Emergency Resource Allocation: Implement a policy for time-sensitive research or critical data processing, offering temporary priority override.

Transparency in Resource Allocation: Maintain a transparent record or dashboard to display resource allocation and usage, enhancing trust and understanding among users.

Semi-Priority Queue Access: For investors unable to meet the minimum investment requirements, there may be an opportunity to discuss access to semi-priority queues, contingent upon space availability.
