# Guide for Investors in the Cluster

This document contains an overview of the policies around (a) purchasing additional equipment for the DSI cluster and (b) the priorities that we can grant on that provisioned hardware.

Our major framework:
1. We want to encourage group investment in the DSI cluster by granting priorities to specific purchased hardware to the people/project who made that purchase.
2. We want to make sure that all purchased hardware conforms to the requirements of the cluster.
3. We want to make sure that there is a defined lifecycle policy associated with each purchase.

This document contains a description of the implemention details of this framework.

### Grant-Based Access

### Minimum Investment for Priority Hardware Solution:

    The minimum investment required to gain priority access to hardware is approximately $100,000. However, the specific hardware specifications fluctuate due to current technological trends and market availability.
    Estimated current minimum investment (Winter 2024):
        4x Nvidia H100 80GB GPUs
        2x Intel LGA4677 CPUs
        1TB RAM 
        Misc. server components and cables
        Total Cost: $113,332.40
    For up-to-date information on the minimum required specifications, please contact DSI Techstaff.

Duration of Access:

    Investors who meet the investment requirements will receive priority access to the hardware they fund for the duration of the grant.


Handling Grants without a Defined Timeline

    Default Allocation: Grants without a specified timeline will have a default allocation period of three years. Extensions require discussion and agreement.
    Provisional Allocations: Initial allocation period with options for extension based on progress and resource availability.
    Project Milestones: Regular milestone reporting is encouraged or required for ongoing validation of resource allocation.


Additional Considerations

    Resource Re-allocation Post-Grant: Develop policies for transitioning resources back to the general pool after the grant period, including a phased reduction in priority and a grace period for data migration.
    Over-Subscription Policies: Implement policies for over-subscription to optimize resource utilization. Clear guidelines will manage and prioritize over-subscription.
    Emergency Resource Allocation: Implement a policy for time-sensitive research or critical data processing, offering temporary priority override.
    Transparency in Resource Allocation: Maintain a transparent record or dashboard to display resource allocation and usage, enhancing trust and understanding among users.
    Semi-Priority Queue Access: For investors unable to meet the minimum investment requirements, there is an opportunity to discuss access to semi-priority queues, contingent upon space availability.
