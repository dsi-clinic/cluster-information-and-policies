## Questions

### What are the requirements for getting access to this cluster?

Users of the DSI have to meet one of the following criteria:

1. Have a DSI-related grant.
2. Be in the DSI or a DSI affiliated faculty (with some exceptions).
3. Be a student with written approval by a DSI faculty mentor.

If you are looking for compute resources and are more generally affiliated with the University we recommend contacting [RCC](https://rcc.uchicago.edu/).


### I want to install additional software.


### Is there a way to use the cluster via a GUI?

You maybe able to set up X11 forwarding for using software that requires a GUI. This is not the intended use of the cluster and while users are allowed to access X11 forwarding, it is not supported behavior. You can find a brief "How-to" [here](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/the-clinic/blob/main/tutorials/X11.md)
