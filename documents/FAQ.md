## Questions

### What are the requirements for getting access to this cluster?


### I want to install additional software.


### Is there a way to use the cluster via a GUI?

You maybe able to set up X11 forwarding for using software that requires a GUI. This is not the intended use of the cluster and while users are allowed to access X11 forwarding, it is not supported behavior. You can find a brief "How-to" [here](https://github.com/dsi-clinic/the-clinic/blob/main/tutorials/X11.md)
