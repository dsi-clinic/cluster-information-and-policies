# UChicago DSI Cluster — NIST CSF 2.0 SFA Compliance Plan

**Target Tier:** Tier 2 (Risk Informed)
**Branch:** `policies-and-procedures`
**Beads Prefix:** `sfa`
**Date:** 2026-03-31

---

## Changelog

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| 2026-04-01 | Downloaded all 15 CS security policy documents from Google Docs for review. Added per-policy evaluation checklist to plan (see "CS Policy Evaluation Queue" section). Policies will be added to the Jekyll site individually after approval. Open question #2 partially resolved — docs are now accessible for review. |
| 2026-03-31 | Initial plan created. |

---

## Executive Summary

The University of Chicago's Security Framework Assessment (SFA) requires DSI to document compliance with 71 NIST CSF 2.0 controls. Each control requires both a **policy** (high-level intent — the "what" and "why") and a **procedure** (operational steps — the "how," "who," and "when").

| Status | Count | Action Required |
|--------|------:|-----------------|
| Have policy, need procedure | 15 | Write matching procedures |
| Need both policy + procedure | 56 | Write both |
| Have procedure | 0 | — |
| **Total** | **71** | |

### Tier 2 Hard Gate

Control **ID.AM-03** explicitly requires a **network architecture diagram** showing internal and external data flows. This is stated as "a necessary (but not sufficient) requirement to choose Tier 2."

---

## Existing Documentation That Maps to SFA Controls

Much of what DSI already does is documented on the cluster site but not framed as formal SFA artifacts. These can be formalized with relatively low effort.

## Controls with Existing Policies (Need Procedures Only)

These 15 controls have policy documents in Google Docs. Each needs a corresponding procedure document. **Before importing to the Jekyll site, each policy must be individually reviewed and approved** (see "CS Policy Evaluation Queue" below).

## CS Policy Evaluation Queue

The 15 CS security policy documents below were downloaded from Google Docs on 2026-04-01. Each must be individually reviewed, approved, and then imported into the Jekyll site as `_policies/cs-<slug>.md` with corresponding navigation entries. Once approved, a policy should be added to the site and the procedure document can be written.

| 15 | RC.CO-03.01 | Communication of Recovery Activities | `cs-recovery-communication` | [ ] | [ ] | [ ] |

**Workflow for each policy:**
1. **Review** — Read the Google Doc and confirm content is accurate and appropriate for the DSI cluster context
2. **Approve** — Sign off on the policy (note any required edits)
3. **Import to site** — Create `_policies/cs-<slug>.md` with Jekyll front matter and add to `_data/navigation.yml`
4. **Write procedure** — Create the matching procedure document for the SFA control

## HPC-Specific Considerations (NIST SP 800-223 / SP 800-234)

NIST has published HPC-specific security guidance that should inform our policies and procedures.

### Four-Zone Reference Architecture (SP 800-223)

| Zone | Description | DSI Equivalent | Key Threats |
|------|-------------|----------------|-------------|
| Access Zone | User entry point | SSH gateway, login nodes | Credential harvesting, brute force |
| Management Zone | Admin and control plane | SLURM controller, config management | Privilege escalation, config tampering |
| Computing Zone | Job execution | 29 GPU/CPU nodes | Side-channel attacks, cryptomining, data leakage between users |
| Data Storage Zone | Storage and archival | /home, /project, /scratch (1.5 PB) | Unauthorized access, data exfiltration |

### HPC-Specific Risks to Address in Documentation

- **Multi-tenancy:** OverSubscribe policy means multiple jobs share GPU nodes — risk of data leakage between users
- **Extended sessions:** 12-hour job limit increases credential exposure window
- **Compute node isolation:** Compute nodes should not be directly routable from outside the cluster
- **Performance vs. security tradeoffs:** Full-disk encryption and endpoint agents typical in enterprise IT may be inappropriate for compute nodes
- **Centralized logging:** Best practice is a syslog server on an isolated system for forensic baseline

---

## Open Questions (Decisions Needed Before Implementation)

1. **Where should documents live?** Options:
   - (a) New pages in `_policies/` on the Jekyll site
   - (b) Google Docs (matching the 15 existing policies)
   - (c) Both — policies in Google Docs, procedures on the site
   - (d) All in the repo as markdown files under `Policies and Procedures/`

2. ~~**Existing Google Docs policies:** Can we access and review the 15 existing policy documents to ensure procedures align with them?~~ **PARTIALLY RESOLVED (2026-04-01):** All 15 CS policy documents have been downloaded from Google Docs and are queued for individual review (see "CS Policy Evaluation Queue" section). Each must be approved before being added to the Jekyll site.

3. **Network diagram (ID.AM-03):** Do we have an existing diagram, or must one be created from scratch? What is the actual network topology (VLANs, switches, firewall rules, external connectivity)?

4. **Monitoring tools in use:** What specific tools are currently deployed? (e.g., Nagios, Prometheus, Grafana, SLURM accounting, syslog, UChicago central SIEM integration)

5. **Backup details:** What is the actual backup system? Frequency, retention, offsite copies, restore testing history?

6. **UChicago central IT relationship:** Which controls does UChicago's central IT/Information Assurance handle vs. DSI? (e.g., network firewall, SIEM, vulnerability scanning, physical data center security)

7. **Configuration management:** Is Ansible/Puppet/Salt or similar used? Are configs version-controlled?

8. **Timeline:** When is the next SFA assessment due?
